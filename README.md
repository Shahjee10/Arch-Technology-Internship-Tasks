# 📌 Internship Task 2 – Titanic Survival Prediction (ML Classification)

## 📝 Overview
This task focuses on the **Titanic Survival Prediction** problem, a classic **binary classification** dataset.  
The objective was to clean the dataset, encode categorical columns, visualize relationships, and train ML models to predict survival.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – data cleaning  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** – ML models & preprocessing

- Filled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`)  
- Dropped unnecessary columns  
- Avoided chained assignment warnings by safe DataFrame updating  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Count plots for `Survived`, `Sex`, `Pclass`  
- Heatmap for correlations  
- Distribution plots for Age & Fare  
- Insights: Women & children had higher survival rate

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Converted categorical columns using:
  ```python
  df.replace({'Sex': {'male': 0, 'female': 1},
              'Embarked': {'S': 0, 'C': 1, 'Q': 2}})
### 3️⃣ Feature Selection & Scaling
- Selected relevant features for training  
- Scaled numerical columns  

### 4️⃣ Model Building
Trained multiple ML models:

# 📌 Internship Task 3 – Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📝 Overview
This project was completed as **Internship Task 3 (Month 2)** during my internship at **ARCH Technologies**.  
The objective of this task was to perform **Customer Segmentation** using **Unsupervised Machine Learning** techniques to identify meaningful customer groups based on purchasing behavior.

Using a mall customer dataset, I applied the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to segment customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**, helping businesses better understand customer patterns and improve targeted marketing strategies.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – data handling & preprocessing  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – K-Means clustering & preprocessing  

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration
- Loaded the mall customer dataset  
- Explored dataset structure using `.head()` and `.info()`  
- Key features used: `Annual Income`, `Spending Score`

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Selected relevant numerical features  
- Checked for missing values  
- Prepared data for clustering  

### 3️⃣ Optimal Cluster Selection
- Used the **Elbow Method**  
- Identified **5 optimal clusters** for segmentation  

### 4️⃣ Model Building
- Applied **K-Means clustering** with `k = 5`  
- Assigned cluster labels to each customer  

### 5️⃣ Visualization & Interpretation
- Visualized clusters using scatter plots  
- Analyzed customer behavior patterns within each cluster  

---

## ✅ Results & Insights
The model successfully identified **5 distinct customer segments**:

- **High income + high spending** – ideal customers for premium offers  
- **High income + low spending** – strong potential for targeted campaigns  
- **Low income + high spending** – loyal value-seeking customers  
- **Low income + low spending** – budget-conscious customers  
- **Medium income + balanced spending** – stable and consistent group  

This analysis demonstrates how **Unsupervised Learning** can uncover hidden patterns in customer data and support **data-driven business decisions**.
